                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="ui blue header">The company slogan</h3>
                    <p>The Sweratel “Coolness” represents our Vision and Innovation – new system products and services that demands attention, stands apart, uniqueness, varies from the norm or violates existing expectations in a way that draws attention or respect.</p>

                    <p>What drives the “coolness” factor?.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Design is a key component – creating sleek product leveraging design that create something cool</li>
                        <li>Solving a traditional problem in a innovative way or combining several disparate capabilities to create a completely new and interesting product or service can be cool</li>
                        <li>Providing a level of service or integration that simplifies a job or provides greater service can be cool </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Coolness is more important for disruptive innovations than for incremental innovations and probably more important for innovations directed at end consumers than business-to-business innovations.</p>
